\begin{cvItemList}
\item \textbf{Enhanced} the unit testing suite for a library with \textbf{200+ contributors} by 
      refactoring operator‑equality method to return detailed mismatch explanations. This improved 
      \textbf{developer experience} by replacing simple boolean outputs with actionable debugging 
      context (\href{https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5780}{PR \#5780}).
\item \textbf{Implemented} the \texttt{QutritChannel} operation
      (\href{https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5793}{PR \#5793}), extending the noise‑modelling 
      framework from qubits to qutrits. The feature is fully documented and part of the public API
      (\href{https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.QutritChannel.html}{docs}).
\item \textbf{Optimized} internal sampling logic in \texttt{shots.bins()}
      (\href{https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5476}{PR \#5476}), achieving a \textbf{50\% 
      performance increase} in shot‑sampling efficiency.
\item \textbf{Extended} the measurement framework by implementing \texttt{process\_counts}
      (\href{https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5256}{PR \#5256}, 
      \href{https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5395}{PR \#5395}), enabling PennyLane to ingest 
      count‑dictionary data directly from external quantum devices.
\end{cvItemList}

\cvHeaderThree{Amazon Braket Python SDK}
\begin{cvItemList}
\item \textbf{Resolved} a naming conflict by enforcing validation against OpenQASM‑reserved identifiers, 
      eliminating runtime errors and ensuring reliable execution of parameterized circuits
      (\href{https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-sdk-python/issues/603}{Issue \#603}, 
      \href{https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-sdk-python/pull/999}{PR \#999}).
\end{cvItemList}

\cvHeaderThree{Qiskit}
\begin{cvItemList}
\item Contributed to fixing Issue \#\href{https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/12106}{12106}, addressing synth\_cnot\_count\_full\_pmh for synthesizing linear reversible circuits.
\end{cvItemList}

\cvHeaderThree{Qbraid-Qir}
\begin{cvItemList}
\item Identified that qbraid-qir generated QIR using a custom profile rather than the expected Base Profile; raised a GitHub issue \#\href{https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/issues/215}{215} to highlight the missing support, which later implemented by the community. 
\end{cvItemList}

\cvHeaderTwo{Quantum Tic Tac Toe}{}
\begin{cvItemList}
\item Developed Quantum Tic Tac Toe, an educational game integrating quantum mechanics concepts like superposition, entanglement, and measurement into classic tic\-tac\-toe gameplay to enhance understanding of quantum principles
\item Deployed the game on a \href{https://quantumtictactoe-ekm2cauxbumdelekkkaxqz.streamlit.app}{website} for easy access and containerized it with Docker, enabling players to run it locally on their machines.
\item \href{https://github.com/Tarun-Kumar07/QuantumTicTacToe}{Link} to source code.
