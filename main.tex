\cvHeaderThree{Foundation}

\begin{cvItemList}
  \item Improved speed of dataload, bringing down load time from 30mins to 2mins  
\end{cvItemList}

\cvHeaderThree{iCM-Limits - Core Maintainer}
\begin{cvItemList}
  \item Developed core components of a new in-memory calculation engine for computing financial availability (Limit + Utilization), consumed by FNMA to auto-generate DLOD reports.
  \item Implemented configuration-driven logic to compute Limits and Utilizations using weighted Aggregations over filtered transactions.
  \item Contributed to implementation of real-time APIs that validate incoming transactions and flag potential limit breaches before persisting to the system.
  \item Designed and optimized initialization of calculation matrices, eliminating redundant structures to improve memory efficiency and reduce computation time.
  \item Built rule-based filter matching logic to classify and aggregate transactions per account and date, enabling flexible and extensible business configurations.
  \item Implemented rule-based timezone assignment for accounts, supporting attribute-based matching with implicit priority resolution.
  \item Integrated cross-currency calculations by interfacing with FX conversion components and applying approximation policies to ensure accurate limit evaluations.
  \item Integrated diagnostics into the calculation engine to explain calculation failures (e.g., missing opening balances), improving debuggability for support teams.
  \item Optimized Java \texttt{HashMap} usage in critical calculation paths, reducing iteration latency from 6µs to 300ns per cycle.
  \item Implemented logging assertions in the testing infrastructure to detect silent exceptions and validate expected log outputs during end-to-end flows.
  \item Achieved 92\% code coverage with 1000+ Cucumber test cases; FNMA reported zero bugs post-production, demonstrating delivery quality and system reliability.
  \item Contributed to a shared code review framework adopted by all developers, reducing dependency on architects and improving code consistency.
\end{cvItemList}

\cvHeaderThree{iCM-RefData – Core Maintainer}
\begin{cvItemList}
  \item Architected a reusable approval workflow adopted by 5 teams, enabling faster development and consistent business logic implementation.
  \item Refactored Angular front-end, eliminating 2000+ lines of duplicate code and standardizing UI components for better maintainability.
  \item Implemented audit history tracking with Hibernate Envers, allowing users to view change logs directly in the UI.
  \item Developed a Cucumber-based integration testing framework, reducing manual testing efforts during upgrades and accelerating release cycles.
  \item Reviewed code across a shared codebase used by 5 teams, ensuring code quality and enforcing best practices.
  \item Collaborated with platform teams to propose enhancements to the Ion-Foundation framework and led multiple upgrade rollouts.
